# Android-appInfo
A poorly done android application to enable display of complex information about apps installed on the system.
Last change before commit: May 3 2015.

This is usable to get information such as version code, full permissions list, and so on.

I wrote this application because I wanted to know the date I installed another application on my phone. Finding no easy way to do this, I instead wrote an application to show me all of the information that it could feasibly access. As it turns out, that's quite a lot.
